##Music History in Angular

Practice using Angular

Read from two JSON files that have different songs.

1. Put all songs into one array and display the list of songs in the main content area.
2. Have a select element that shows a list of all albums.
3. Have a select element that shows a list of all artists.
4. Now you can walk students through building a bare bones version of Music History in Angular. Clone the angular step-by-step repo and checkout the v1.0 tag to start.
5. Keep checking out the tags up to v6.0 to show them the progressively more complex features.
6.Once you're done walking them through it, assign them the task of building their Music History application in Angular.
